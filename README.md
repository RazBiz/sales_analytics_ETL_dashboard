# sales_analytics_ETL_dashboard
This project simulates a real data engineering pipeline of an multi-store retailer. It is fetching sales information from multiple data sources (API, CSV), performing ETL and ELT using Python and SQL, pushing data to a PostgreSQL data warehousing system, and visualizing key business measures through a web dashboard using a dash framework.
